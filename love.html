								<p>‘It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters.’ </p>
								<p>The first two sentences of Pride and Prejudice have always been the two of my favorite opening lines from any book. They set the stage for all the ridiculousness that is about to happen throughout the rest of the story. Besides, they reflect the social problems concerning young girls of diverse characters, be it optimistic Jane, prudent Elizabeth, introvert Mary and Kitty, or the ignorant flirt Lydia. Jane Austen's works, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.</p>
								<p>The essence of true love illustrated by this novel has always attracted me to read it. Jane Austen's quixotic approach to love through the story of Elizabeth and Darcy makes the audience rage with envy. In reality, every woman dreams of a fairy tale but love won't obey our expectation. Its mystery is pure and absolute. I’m always being attracted to someone who seldom talks. It seems that he has all the mysteries for me to explore. But the hard truth is that I always get disappointed by the difference between my fantasy and reality. In The Bridge of Madison County, Robert James Waller writes, ‘We all live in the past. We take a minute to know someone, one hour to like someone, and one day to love someone, but the whole life to forget someone.’ Maybe that’s why we lose ourselves in love.</p>
								<p>Austen painted a clear picture of how women who lacked fortune oftentimes had to forsake love to be married for economic security and social status. That’s why Mrs. Bennet made great efforts to marry off her five daughters. In modern society, such phenomenon still exists. I do appreciate Elizabeth because she is so independent, headstrong and outspoken. She refused to marry for any reason other than love. In fact, nowadays, women are no longer expected to stay at home and just be a pretty face. We think for ourselves and involve ourselves in politics or careers. Women are authors as men were in the past.</p>
								<p>Sometimes, I just can’t help thinking of the after-marriage life of Darcy and Elizabeth. In China, we say that marriage ruins love. Also in The Bridge of Madison County, it reads, ‘Nobody understands when a woman makes a choice to marry and have children, in one way her life begins, but in another way, it stops.’ Two weeks ago, my elder sister gave birth to her first child. It’s a great happiness to welcome this little new life into our family, but my sister seemed a little frustrated for having to take care of the baby day after day. She used to work for her company, while now she has to stay at home. After marriage and child birth, women build a life of details. Maybe we just stop and stay steady, so that our children can move. And when the children leave, they take our life of details with them. We are expected to move on again, but we don't remember what it was that moved us, because no one's asked us in so long. Not even ourselves. This explains why an increasing number of women prefer to stay single or not to have children in their whole lives.</p>
