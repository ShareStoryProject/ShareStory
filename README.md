# ShareStory

Introduction to our project

Everyone has a story to share, we write a website to communicate with others. There are five parts in our project: Home, Travelling, Literature, Entertainment and Contact. To complete the project together, we divided the tasks into several parts. Lina was responsible for the Home, Literature and Contact part of the page. Yuhang wrote for the Travelling and Andi completed the Entertainment part.

Lina has done a similar website before in university,  so for the header and footer part of this project , we just modified details and contents due to the limited time. In this way, we wrote the main content of the page and ajusted the header and footer parts for the 'ShareStory' website. 
 
In the Home page, the users can sign in and sign up ( which are  fake ones). They can go to the part they want to read directly by clicking the buton. Besides, there are some introductions to our writers of the stories. At the bottom of the page, there is some contact information for the users.

The Literature page is composed of three parts: reading up-to-date stories of our site, recommendation of good books and reading online articles. Each part of the Literature is written in different styles. For 'Read More', I add three HTML for the users to read the articles in detail. Similarly, I add the contact information in this page.

Andi: I have written the part of "Entertainment" page, which show the stories of music and film. I have also written a CSS for this page and also a CSS for the "header. I have also written 2 link pages "yourstory1.html" and "yourstory2.html" for this page and also a CSS for the link pages. I have written the "header.css" with the help of the files which is offered by Lina. the "Entertainment" page contains 3 parts except the header and the footer. And the page "Entertainment" is well responsive.

Yuhang: I am responsible for the "Travelling" page, which showing the travelling stories. This page contains six parts: Header, sidebar(writer's introduction), three parts about travelling stories with different layouts, footer. According to the footer which Lina offered, I simulated it and created a simple one for this page. The page is responsive.

Finally, the Contact part contains a Google Map API, a contact form and the precise information to contact us. 

Our site is clearly displayed and well ajusted to the size of the screen.
