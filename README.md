# ShareStory

Introduction to our project

Everyone has a story to share, we write a website to communicate with others. There are five parts in our project: Home, Travelling, Literature, Entertainment and Contact.

We have done a similar website before in university,  so for the header and footer part of this projectwe we just modified details and contents due to the limited time. In this way, we wrote the main content of the page and ajusted the header and footer parts for the 'ShareStory' website. 

In the Home page, the users can sign in and sign up (which are  fake ones). They can go to the part they want to read directly by clicking the buton. Besides, there are some introductions to our writers of the stories. At the bottom of the page, there is some contact information for the users.

The Literature page is composed of three parts: reading up-to-date stories of our site, recommendation of good books and reading online articles. Each part of the Literature is written in different styles. For 'Read More', I add three HTML for the users to read the articles in detail. Similiarly, I add the contact information in this page.

Finally, the Contact part contains a Google Map API, a contact form and the precise information to contact us. 

Our site is clearly displayed and well ajusted to the size of the screen.
