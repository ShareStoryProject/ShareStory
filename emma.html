								<p>I loved Emma, as I have done with every other novel by Jane Austen. In my opinion she was a genius! </p>
								<p>I find her style of writing enjoyable to read; her plots are funny and full of wit. She uses irony to ridicule the upper classes of her time and also paint a vivid picture for how the women of that class led their lives.</p>
								<p>Emma Woodhouse is a financially secure woman who remarkably is in a state of power in her household. This gives her the option to ‘never marry.’ However, Jane Fairfax is not so lucky and is set on the path of employment as a governess. Set in the country town of Highbury, Emma lives at Hartfield with her father, neighbours to their dear friends at Randalls – Mr and Mrs Weston. Emma fancies herself the master of matchmaking and, when the mysterious Frank Churchill reconnects with his father Mr Weston, mischief and heartbreak ensues.</p>
								<p>The plot was amusing and engaging and I genuinely found it a real page-turner. Despite the fact that Austen narrates their drama with a slight tone of sarcasm I still felt like I connected with the characters and actually cared what happened to them. I even liked Miss Bates, the annoying aunt of Jane Fairfax who had sunk from prosperity into unfortunate circumstances.</p>
								<p>The romance aspect to it was one of the reasons that I loved it so much; I really wanted the characters to figure out who was engaged to who because as the reader I already knew. It was exciting and fun and made Emma overall light-hearted and a joy to read from beginning to end.</p>
