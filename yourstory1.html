<h6>Country road, take me home</h6>

	Almost heaven, West Virginia<br>
　　Blue Ridge Mountain, Shenandoah River<br>
　　Life is old there<br>
　　Older than the trees<br>
　　Younger than the mountains<br>
　　Growing like a breeze<br>
　　Country roads, take me home<br>
　　To the place I belong<br>
　　West Virginia, Mountain Mama<br>
　　Take me home, country roads<br>
　　All my memories gather round her<br>
　　Miner's Lady stranger to blue water<br>
　　Dark and dusty painted on the sky<br>
　　Misty taste of moonshine<br>
　　Tear drops in my eyes<br>
　　Country roads, take me home<br>
　　To the place I belong<br>
　　West Virginia, Mountain Mama<br>
　　Take me home, country roads<br>

	This is an old song, it has been sung for many years. But when the first time that I heard about it. It reminded me a lot; it reminded me the old time with my family; it made me think of my family and all the things they have done for me.<br>
	All of these words touched me a lot. When I was young, I began to study in the other city. The home was always the warmest thing for me. <br>
	My parents give me a lot, they told me to be a good person. They give me all the support that I need. They always encourage me to challenge and to make a difference.<br>
	The song is easy, but the meaning is further.<br>
