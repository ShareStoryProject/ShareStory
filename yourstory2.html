	You know why I watch this movie, because inside the actor and your eyes like.<br>
	And I think of us, I once did not belong to you, and I exist with a space-time. Had the opportunity to reach out, but that, after all, is only wishful thinking of our two Xiaowucai.<br>

	I also want to play with you dare to play the game, because I know that your character will this game go on. However, we have no results, I know. You know, is not it.<br>

	The first time I cried, and crying from the beginning to the end, not because of how their love earth-shattering, but I know that they are destined not together.<br>
	Doomed to not be together, these words make me particularly vulnerable. I know, in the eyes of many people, I do do all-conquering female warrior, but in fact how fragile my heart, even you do not know.<br>
	Finally, I disguised too good, and even feel that I have not long before the fragile me.<br>

	I forced myself to forget, forget a lot of things, so that their normal life on track, like love you love other boys.<br>
	I can not do it. You are very special, lost people and things, like the old days of the past, not to say that you can abandon the abandoned. At least for me, this is the case.<br>

	I love you most when I watch this movie.<br>
